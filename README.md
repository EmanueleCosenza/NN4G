# NN4G (Neural Network For Graphs)
This repository contains a Python implementation of NN4G, a constructive neural network for graphs.
The model is defined in [Micheli, Alessio. "Neural network for graphs: A contextual constructive approach." IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 20.3 (2009): 498-511.
](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4773279)
The network is constructive, which means that it automatically finds the right number of units during training.
