# NN4G (Neural Network For Graphs)
This repository contains a Python implementation of NN4G, a constructive neural network for graphs, with new architectural and training variants.
The neural network is defined in [Micheli, Alessio. "Neural network for graphs: A contextual constructive approach." IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 20.3 (2009): 498-511](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4773279).
This project has been developed as part of my undergraduate thesis at the University of Pisa under the supervision of Alessio Micheli.
The network is constructive, which means that it automatically finds the right number of units during training.
