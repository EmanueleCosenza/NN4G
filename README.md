# NN4G (Neural Network For Graphs)
NN4G is a constructive neural network for graphs defined in [Micheli, Alessio. "Neural network for graphs: A contextual constructive approach." IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 20.3 (2009): 498-511](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4773279).
This repository contains a Python implementation of NN4G with new architectural and training variants, a validation system for the network and `pynn4g`, a basic command line interface.
This project has been developed as part of my undergraduate thesis at the University of Pisa under the supervision of Professor Alessio Micheli.
e network is constructive, which means that it automatically finds the right number of units during training.

## Project structure
- `model.py` contains everything related to the NN4G model.
